## Brainfuck toolsuite

Two years ago I decided to explore brainfuck language and realised that I needed
some tools to learn it properly. I started by implementing a compiler, which
translate brainfuck code to linux executable, then a interpreter. I also built a
small tool that allows a "conversion" from python3 code to brainfuck, and a 
debugger.
I do not use these tools anymore but I guess it can be useful.
Python3, low quality code and bugs.

You can find it on my github.
