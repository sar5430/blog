## Prisoners_dilemma crackme 

This is a solution to the 4aca7f6c's crackme prisoners_dilemma.

The crackme is available [here](https://crackmes.one/crackme/5c5cb48233c5d43fd9a9386f )

It took me almost 4 days to solve prisonner_dilemma. 4aca7f6c set its difficulty
to 3, but he was very modest. I hesitate to set it to 4 or 5 when I managed to
solve it. In order to see the correct message printed on your screen, you need
to solve 3 little maths game. The very interesting part of this crackme is that
theses little games are really easy to understand, but pretty difficult to solve
within the constraints of the crackme. I'll decompose this crackme in 6 steps:

- The encryption and mix-up
- The games' hidden codes
- Game_1
- Game_2
- Game_3
- Generate the input

First things first, let's start with the encryption.

### Encryption and mixup

The program isn't obfuscated at all, and we can clearly see the control flow. It
starts by printing the ASCII-ART, ask for the input, and read 0x100 bytes on the 
standard input.
The program then checks if the index of the first "\n" is 42, and exit if not.
If the first occurence of "\n" is at index 42, the program map 0x400 bytes with
the permissions RWX.
Then the program calls the function "encrypt_string", with our input as second 
argument.

The algorithm is easy to understand, here's how it works:

- It starts by xoring our input with a 42 bytes length hardcoded key.
- It cut the input in two half-parts B1 and B2 of length 21 each.
- Then it perform a custom encryption which is repeated 50 times.
- Finally it xor the result with an other 42 bytes length hardcoded key.

I did not try to understand how this algorithm was working. I just noticed a
small but important thing: If we consider the input as two distincts parts (B1 
and B2), the modification of a byte at the index i (for B1 or B2), will not
modify the previous bytes at the index <= i (for B1 and B2). It'll allow us to
bruteforce the solution at the end.

To be a bit more precise, let's imagine this hexstring and its encrypted version:

```
index		0 1 2 3 4 5 6
input		41424344454647
encrypted	fadbe34522254e
```

Then if we change the 5th byte of the input, only the 5th and the 6th bytes will
be modified in the encrypted output.

Now that it's clear, let's keep moving. Our input is now encrypted, the program
enter the function game_1. In the three differents games, the first function 
called is the one I called "Check_and_mixup".

This function (which is at 0x400b2d) accept two arguments:

- A part of our encrypted input
- An array of 32 bytes int, where array[i] = i

It perform a check on a part of the encrypted input, then mixup and array 
regarding the encrypted part. Again, here's how it works.

- In game_1, the string which is checked is encrypted_input[0:0xd] (len = 0xd)
- In game_2, the string which is checked is 
encrypted_input[0xd:0x1b] (len = 0xe)
- In game_3, the string which is checked is 
encrypted_input[0x1b:0x2a] (len = 0xf)

The check is very simple:

```py
for i in range(len(part)):
	if part[i] > i:
		return false
return true
```

This means that the bytes at position 0, 0xd, and 0x1b are 0. 
The bytes at position 1, 0xe and 0x1c are 0 or 1. 
The bytes at position 2, 0xf and 0x1d are 0, 1 or 2.
Etc.

The mixup is pretty simple too. Once the check is passed, the program loop on 
each bytes of the encrypted part starting at the last ones, and swap the byte at
the index i with the byte at the index encrypted_part[i].

Here's the algorithm:

```py
i = len(encrypted_part) - 1
while i >= 0:
	swap(array[i], array[encrypted_part[i]])
	i -= 1
```

This function give us an unique permutation of the original array. Let's keep
moving to the next part.

### Game's hidden codes 

Now that our input has generated an unique permutation of the original array, 
this array will be used to modify the control flow of the program.

In each game, a function is called just after the `Check_and_mixup`. I named it
`Modify_hidden_code`.

Let's talk about the games' hidden codes. In the .rodata section, there are 3
arrays of byte `0x4017c0 -> game_3, 0x4019a0 -> game_2, 0x401ba0 -> game_1`.

these arrays are executable code. Each array is composed by:

	- An initializer
	- A dispatcher
	- Some blocks of code which I call "meta-instructions"

these meta-instructions all look the same in the original on-disk file. We can
enumerate then. Let's say that for a array, the block 0 will be the one at the
lowest address, followed by the block 1, etc.

	- 1 or 2 operation on registers
	- mov r13, 0
	- jump dispatcher

The dispatcher jump to the next meta-instruction, regarding the value in r13.
Obviously, at runtime, the `0` of the `mov r13, 0` instructions are modified,
regarding the unique permutation generated by the encrypted_input ! 

If the array generated by the encrypted input is
`[0xb, 0x1, 0x4, 0x3, 0x6, 0x00, 0x2, 0x7, 0x8, 0x9, 0xc, 0xa, 0x5]`

Then the control flow will be:

- Initializer
- Dispatcher 
- Meta-instruction 0xb
- Dispatcher
- Meta-instruction 0x1
- Dispatcher
- [...]
- Meta-instruction 0x5
- Dispatcher

We now have all elements to start to look at the games.

### GAME 1

Let's start with game_1 !
Once the `Check_and_mixup` and `Modify_hidden_code` are executed, the program 
initialize two arrays of 7 32-bit integer.
- The first array is populated with random values % 7.
- The second one is populated with -1 in the 7 32-bits values.

Then the program call the `hidden_code_game_1`, which is below.
When the hidden code returns, it checks for each 7 32-bits values of both arrays
if `array[i] == array2[i]`. If this assertion is false for all the 7 values,
the input is wrong.
In order to really validate that our permutation (= controlflow) is the good 
one, the program does this 50 times.

Let's have a look at the hidden code:

```

  401ba2:	49 89 d0             	mov    r8,rdx

```

What I did is pretty simple: moving the value in array[0] to array2[0].
This is possible with the following sequence of blocks:

`0x09,0x05,0x0c,0x0a,0x02,0x03`

We only used 6 of the 13 given blocks, so we can just append the others blocks.

We now have our first permutation array ! We need to find the input, that will
produces the permutation:

`[0x09,0x05,0x0c,0x0a,0x02,0x03,0x00,0x06,0x01,0x08,0x04,0x07,0x0b]`

*NOTE: After some discussions with 4aca7f6c, this solution wasn't intended, 
and the original problem was refering to the rainbow_hats_puzzle, which is well
explained [here](
https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/149915/rainbow-hats-puzzle).*

Anyway, that was a good and pretty easy start, and the second game will be WAY
much harder.
				    
### GAME 2

In my opinion, game_2 was the hardest. This time, the program initialize an
array of 50 elements. It starts by setting `array[i] = i`, then it mix-up the
array using the Fisher-Yates algorithm. It is well explained everywhere on
internet. I will not describe it because the important thing is that the program
initialize an array of 50 elements, containing the number from 0 to 49, randomly
shuffled.

Then, the program call the hidden code with a pointer on this array as an input.

When the hidden code stop, the program does the following:

```py
r = rand() % 50
c = 25
i = r
while c >= 0:
	if array[i] == r:
		return good
	i = array[i]
return wrong
```

The code is terribly simple. What it does is taking a random integer r between 0 
and 49, and then check in the array if the element at index r is r. If not the
new index to look at is the element that was compared to r. If it has to do this
less than 25 times to find the value r, you're good. If not, you lose. Here's a
scheme to fully understand how it works.

```

            +------>24 +--------> 37 +----------12+
            |                                     |
            +                                     |
+--------> 17                                     |
            ^                                     v
            |                                     19
            |                                     +
            |                                     |
            |                                     |
            +                                     |
            7<-------------+48<--------+3<--------+
```

In this exemple, the random number picked by the program is 17. At the index 17,
there's 24. At the index 24, there's 37, etc. It takes the program 8 step to
find the random value 17. 

In this exemple, it works. But most of the time, the Fisher-Yates algorithm will
shuffle the array in a way that there will be a linked-list containing more than
25 elements. To be precise, the algorithm will create N linked lists, where
`1 <= N <= 50`. (50 means that the list is not shuffled and each element is equal
to its index). Obviously, the sum lengths of the N linked list is 50.

So what do we have to do ? As in game_1, we have to find an algorithm that take 
an array as input, and shuffle the array in a way that all looped linked-list
with length > 25 will be removed. The number hasn't been randomly chose. It's
the exact half of the array's length. It means that if there's a looped linked 
list containing more than 25 elements, it's the only one in the array. It's 
obvious, the sum of all lengths is exactly equal to 50, so if a list contains at
least 26 elements, the others cannot contain more than 24.

Let's look at the hidden code:

```
  4019a0:	41 50                	push   r8
  4019a2:	4d 31 c0             	xor    r8,r8

I commented the blocks numbers, as in game_1's hidden code. Let's have a look at
the blocks. The block_1 is important, it's the one that allow us to swap the
element at index `rcx` and `r9`. But then after the execution of this block, the
program jumps to block_7 which exit. It means that we need to satisfy the
conditions by swapping two elements just one time.

Finding the algorithm was really hard for me and took me almost 2 days. I was
missing a small thing.

Here's the first idea I had in python:

```
for i, c in enumerate(array):
	len, ele25 = count_len_list_and_get_25th_element(array[i])
	if len > 25:
		swap(array, i, ele25)
		break
```

The algorithm is really simple, and it totally works in python ! With just one 
swap, the length of the longest linked-list in the array is <= 25!

The problem is that it's IMPOSSIBLE to implement this with the blocks we have in
the hidden code. You cannot get the 25th element of the list. 

The solution is not far from this algo, but is way more subtle. When you're
searching for the r value in the linked list, just increment a second pointer
when two elements are find. 
So you'll need two pointers, the one which count the elements, and the one which
is incremented when the counter count 2!

Another graph to explain:


When you start:

```
counter_ptr      +------>24 +--------> 37 +--------> 12+
semi_ptr         |                                     |
                 +                                     |
     +--------> 17                                     |
                 ^                                     v
                 |                                     19
                 |                                     +
                 |                                     |
                 |                                     |
                 +                                     |
                 7<-------------+48<----------+3<------+
```

Then

```
                      counter_ptr

                       +
                       |
                       |
                       v
semi_ptr      +------>24 +--------> 37 +--------> 12+
              |                                     |
              +                                     |
  +--------> 17                                     |
              ^                                     v
              |                                     19
              |                                     +
              |                                     |
              |                                     |
              +                                     |
              7<--------------+48<--------+3<-------+
```

Then

```
                 semi_ptr       counter_ptr

                    +             +
                    |             |
                    v             v
            +------>24 +--------> 37 +--------> 12+
            |                                     |
            +                                     |
+--------> 17                                     |
            ^                                     v
            |                                     19
            |                                     +
            |                                     |
            |                                     |
            +                                     |
            7<--------------+48<--------+3<-------+
```

Then at the end:

```

                 +------>24 +--------> 37 +--------> 12+
counter_ptr      |                                     |
                 +                                     |
     +--------> 17                                     |
                 ^                                     v           semi_ptr
                 |                                     19 <--------+
                 |                                     +
                 |                                     |
                 |                                     |
                 +                                     |
                 7<--------------+48<--------+3<-------+
```

And then you just have to swap the elements in `semi_ptr` and `counter_ptr`.

After this, the graph now looks like:

```
 +--->24+----->37+----->12
 |                       +
 |                       |
 +                       |
 19<---------------------+

+------------------------>17
|                          +
|                          |
|                          |
+                          |
7<--------+48<------+3<----+
```

We just divided the looped linked list of length 8 in 2 looped linked-lists of
length 4 each.

Once you find the algorithm, finding the good blocks is pretty easy. 

Here's what we need:

```
[0x0b,0x0c,0x0d,0x02,0x08,0x09,0x04,0x00,0x03,0x0a,0x06,0x01,0x05,0x07]
```


### GAME 3

The last game is pretty cool too, and is pretty similar to the second one in its
construction. The program starts by generating a random value r between 2500 and
5000. It then malloc an array of r 32 bits integers. It then initialize this
array with the values `(i + 1) % r` at the index `i`.

The array looks like this

```
[1, 2, 3, 4, ..., r - 1, 0]
```

The hidden_code of game_3 is called, the programs checks if its return value
is < r. Then call the check function, which accept the array and the return
value of the hidden code as input.

Here's what the check function does:

```py
def check(array, return_value_hidden):
    cpt = 0
    cur = 0
    while True:
        v3 = array[cur]
        if cur == v3:
            break
        v4 = array[v3]
        array[cur] = v4
        cur = v4
    if cur == return_value_hidden:
    	return good
    return false
```

I did not try to understand this mixing algorithm, I just looked at the values 
of cur at the end of the function for `2 <= i <= 2500`, and looked for a
pattern.

Here's the result:

```
cur = 0 i: 2

```

It's pretty easy to recognize the pattern. For a value i, we find the biggest 
power of two below i, let's call it p, then `cur = 2*(i - p)`.

Now, let's look at the hidden code, and build this algorithm.

The first things we see are the weird constants in the code. Googling them 
quickly gives some informations about a counting bit algorithm which is
described [here](
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15966920/explanation-of-a-method-of-counting
-set-bits-in-a-32-bit-integer)

The algorithm is short:

```C
v = v - ((v >> 1) & 0x55555555);                  
v = (v & 0x33333333) + ((v >> 2) & 0x33333333);    
c = ((v + (v >> 4) & 0xF0F0F0F) * 0x1010101) >> 24;
```

and what it does is simple: counting the number of bit set in an 32-bit integer.

This gaves us a big part of the needed permutation !
It's easy to understand that we will count the number of bits set in a number,
and if it's equal to 1, then this number is a power of 2.

Let's build the rest of the algo. But first, let's have a look at the binary
representation of r and cur for a given r, let's say 2804.
```
If r = 2804, i = 2*(2804 - 2048) = 1512
bin(2804) = 0b101011110100
bin(1512) = 0b10111101000
```

these two numbers are almost similar in base 2! In fact, we just have to flip
the highest bit of 2804, then shift left the number just one time (multiply by 2
), and we have cur.

Suppose that r is the length of our array. First, we initialize an integer 
`mask = 0xffffffff` (all bit 1 set) (block_7).
Then we count the number of bits set of `(mask & r)` (block_3 and the counting 
bit algorithm). If it's greater than 1 (block_2), we shift left mask by 1 
(block_C), and do it again. If it's one, we flip all the bits of mask (block_1).

For r = 2804, `number_of_bit_set(r & 0b11111111111111111111110000000000)` = 1.
So we flip all bits of mask (which is a "not"). That gives us:
`mask = 0b00000000000000000000001111111111`

Then we compute `(r & mask)` (block_A), and shift left the result (block_9). 
The value is now equal to `cur` !

Let's chain the blocks:

```
[0x07,0x03,0x00,0x04,0x06,0x0e,0x0d,0x05,0x08,0x0b,0x02,0x0c,0x01,0x0a,0x09].
```


### GENERATE THE INPUT

We now have everything to solve this crackme. Let's quickly remember how our
input is processed. First, our input is encrypted. After the encryption, the
encrypted input is cutted in 3 parts. In each part, the value of byte at index i
must be below or equal i (`array[i] <= i`). these 3 parts of encrypted input 
are used to mixup 3 arrays. The uniques permutations generated are the ones 
which build the control flow graph of the 3 hiddens codes.

What do we do now ? We know how works the algorithms, and we what we need for
the permutations:

```
game_1: [0x09,0x05,0x0c,0x0a,0x02,0x03,0x00,0x06,0x01,0x08,0x04,0x07,0x0b],
game_2: [0x0b,0x0c,0x0d,0x02,0x08,0x09,0x04,0x00,0x03,0x0a,0x06,0x01,0x05,0x07]
game_3: [0x07,0x03,0x00,0x04,0x06,0x0e,0x0d,0x05,0x08,0x0b,0x02,0x0c,0x01,0x0a,0x09]
```

I've attached a quick script that will gives us the encrypted input we need to 
generate these permutations. The file is `find_input.py` [1].

Let's run it:

```
io :: crackmes.one/prisoners_delimma » python3 find_input.py 
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 6, 1, 8, 4, 7, 11]
[0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 1, 5, 7]
[0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 5, 8, 1, 2, 1, 1, 10, 9]
```

If we concat these three arrays, we have what what we need for the encrypted
input.
We can find the input that generate the encrypted input with the script
prisoners.py [2].

The warden is feeling generous today, and wants to play a 
game. If you win, you may leave with your freedom, but if 
you lose....                                              

Think long and hard about your strategy, because you only 
get one chance.                                           

Your move: 
You won! In utter disbelief, the warden is forced to let
you go....

Finally, it works !
